IoT Security Scripts

This package contains scripts for Internet of Things (IoT) security testing.
These tools help identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in IoT devices:

- Device discovery and fingerprinting
- Protocol analysis (MQTT, CoAP, etc.)
- Default credential testing
- Firmware analysis
- IoT-specific vulnerability scanning

All scripts are provided for educational purposes only and should be used only on
devices you own or have explicit permission to test.
